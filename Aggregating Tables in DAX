While generally ideal to aggregate/group data in 'M', sometimes this is not possible as you have created a calculated column that used DAX.
This will not be shown when inside of the query editor. The solution to this is to create a DAX table through the 'SUMMARIZE' function. 


Aggregated Table = SUMMARIZE(table,field1,field2,field3,fieldX,"Aggregate1title",COUNT(field_n),"Aggregate2title",
MIN(field_n1),"Aggregate3title",MAX(field_n2))
