For reports and dashboards to be updated hourly or daily, a dynamic value is often required based on the changing dates.
The 'DATESBETWEEN' function will act as a filter and only return values that pass the criteria. 
Using 'MAX' date rather than 'TODAY' is important in the case of there being an error or lack of data for today. In that case,
Power BI would simply pull the previous day in that case.

Ex.
Measure (7 Days Back - Max Date) = CALCULATE(field,DATESBETWEEN(date_field, MAX(date_field)-6,MAX(date_field)))
Measure (13 Days Back - 8 Days Back) = CALCULATE(field,DATESBETWEEN(date_field, MAX(date_field)-13,MAX(date_field)-7))

Using these multiple measures, we can now evaluate the deviation week to week (or whatever date range is set)
Measure (7 Days Back - Max Date)/Measure (13 Days Back - 8 Days Back) = Change From Last Week
